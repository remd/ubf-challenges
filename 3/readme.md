# Challenge 3
---------

Write a program that reads "bhaarat.txt", and takes the languages that begin with "H" or "S" and writes them to another file, named "out.txt". Then have the program write "23. English" to the end to continue the list in "bhaarat.txt".

## Notes
---------

I've omitted some working files from the git repository to preserve the original source text in the repository for others looking to fork this. This is why my source code targets a file called src.txt.
