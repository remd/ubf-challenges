"Write a program to take a person's forum name, age, forum user id (a postive integer equal to or between 1 and 999999). The program should ask for each datum individually, and not go to the next unless the previous was valid. If there is an error, it must prompt again until it is write or the program is halted. The entry "quit" should exit the program at any question."
